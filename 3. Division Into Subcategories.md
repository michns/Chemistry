# 3. Division Into Subcategories

For a more detailed categorisation let's split all the chemical
elements into subcategories using conditional expressions.
All the chemical elements can be assigned to more specyfic categories
depending on their group and period values.
To invoke resulting structure later, it is advisable to utilize 
the CREATE VIEW statement.

***

````sql
CREATE VIEW subcategories AS
SELECT atomic_weight, name, symbol, CASE 
		WHEN "group" = 1 AND period = 1 OR
                     "group" IN(14,15,16) AND period = 2 OR
                     "group" IN(15,16) AND period = 3 OR
                     "group" = 16 AND period = 4 
			THEN 'Reactive nonmetals'
		WHEN "group" = 1 AND (period BETWEEN 2 AND 7) THEN 'Alkali metals'
		WHEN "group" = 2 AND (period BETWEEN 2 AND 7) THEN 'Alkaline earth metals'
		WHEN ("group" BETWEEN 3 AND 12) AND (period IN (4,5)) OR
                     ("group" BETWEEN 4 AND 12) AND (period IN (6,7))
			THEN 'Transition metals'
		WHEN "group" = 13 AND (period BETWEEN 3 AND 7) OR
                     "group" = 14 AND (period BETWEEN 5 AND 7) OR
                     "group" = 15 AND (period  IN(6,7)) OR
                     "group" = 16 AND period = 7
			THEN 'Post-transition metals'
		WHEN "group" = 13 AND period = 2 OR
                     "group" = 14 AND period = 3 OR
                     "group" IN(14, 15) AND period = 4 OR
                     "group" IN(15, 16) AND period = 5 OR
                     "group" = 16 AND period = 6
			THEN 'Metalloids'
		WHEN "group" = 17 THEN 'Halogens'
		WHEN "group" = 18 THEN 'Noble gases'
		WHEN ("group" IS NULL) AND period = 6
			THEN 'Lanthanides'
		WHEN ("group" IS NULL) AND period = 7
			THEN 'Actinides'
		END
		AS subcategory FROM atom ORDER BY subcategory;
````

It is worth mentioning that the group term is a reserved name in SQL.
Therefore, its application as a column name may result in some errors.
To solve this problem the group column name should be quoted
(single ' ', double " ", or using backiticks \` \` - depending of the DBMS used)
or square brackets [ ] should be applied in a case of MSSQL.


Let's inspect the structure  of newly created  view.

***

````sql
SELECT * FROM subcategories;
````

**Output:**

atomic_weight   |     name       |   symbol   |  subcategory  |
----------------|----------------|------------|---------------|
|  227.02775	|   Actinium	 |      Ac    |	  Actinides   |
|  232.038	|   Thorium      |      Th    |	  Actinides   |
|  231.03588    |   Protactinium |      Pa    |   Actinides   |
|  238.0289     |   Uranium      |  	U     |   Actinides   |
|  237.0482     |   Neptunium    |  	Np    |   Actinides   |
|  .            |                |            |               |
|  .            |                |            |               |
|  .            |                |            |               |
