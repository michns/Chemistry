# 4. Subcategories Characteristics

To chararacterize subcategories from the view created in previous
section, we can do a query reffering to its details.
In this example colums called the_lightest and the_heaviests
represents elemets with the smallest and the highest atomic
weight value in each subcategory.
Column named max_minus_min represents difference between 
atomic weight boundary values for each subcategory.

````sql
SELECT MIN(atomic_weight) AS the_lightest,                     
MAX(atomic_weight) AS the_heaviest, AVG(atomic_weight) AS average, 
(MAX(atomic_weight) - MIN(atomic_weight)) AS max_minus_min, subcategory 
FROM subcategories GROUP BY subcategory ORDER BY max_minus_min;
````



**Output:**

| the_lightest |  the_heaviest	|      average	          |     max_minus_min	   |    subcategory               |

To get rid of unnecessary decimal places in the result we can apply the ROUND() function.
The first argument of ROUND() represents the column name that will be rounded,
and the second argument is responsible for decimal places that will be left in the output.
In the presented example results will be rounded to two decimal places.
