# 1. Data Initialization

## Table Initialization

````sql
CREATE TABLE "atom" (
	"atomic_number"	INTEGER NOT NULL UNIQUE,
	"name"	TEXT,
	"symbol" TEXT,
	"atomic_weight"	REAL,
	"metallic_class" TEXT,
    	"group" INTEGER,
    	"period" INTEGER,
	PRIMARY KEY("atomic_number")
);
````
Declerations of columns data types are defined after their names.
Each chemical element is well-defined by its unique atomic
number, with two constraints imposed, so it can be applied
as a primary key. 

***

## Data Insertion 

Let's insert all the chemical elements into the atom table using 
the INSERT INTO statement. 


````sql


````
***

A new table has been created. Let's check the structure of
the newly created dataset.

````sql
SELECT * FROM atom;
````

The table includes the chemical elements known from modern
periodic tables, divided into basic categories: metals,
nonmetals and metalloids.
There is also a more deteiled nomenclature of the chemical 
elements categories which will be introduced and applied in the following sections.
