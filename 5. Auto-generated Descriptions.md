# 5. Auto-generated Descriptions.


Based on the data from the atom table we can present our data in a more descriptive form.
<br>For this purpose it may be helpful to use the || String Concatenation Operator.
<br>x'0a' was applied to obtain line breaks, however in some DBMSs it should be replaced by:
<br>char(10) or '\n'. Let's test descriptive querries for three different chemical elements.

````sql
SELECT name ||' has atomic number '|| atomic_number
      ||' and symbol '|| symbol ||' . '|| x'0a' ||
	   name ||' belongs to the category of '|| metallic_class||'s, '|| x'0a' 
       ||'it is a member of group '|| "group" 
	   ||' and period '|| period ||'.'
 FROM atom WHERE atomic_number = 10;     
````

**Result:**

Neon has atomic number 10 and symbol Ne.
<br>Neon belongs to the category of Nonmetals, 
<br>it is a member of group 18 and period 2.
